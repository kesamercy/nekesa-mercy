            <p>Hello, I'm Nekesa Mercy. I completed a Bachelor of Science, Computer Science degree (May 2020) from Universtiy at Buffalo - State University of New York. Currently based in Washington DC, I enjoy working on projects that use anything Computer Science related

                    <p>To mitigate the impact COVID-19 lock down has had on farmers in rural areas of Uganda, I implemented the concept of community-supported agriculture as a way of providing farmers, who otherwise weren't able to sell their produce in
                        local markets, an alternative online market to sell their products to customers and have it delivered to their doorstep. Raining Vegetables is a platform where people can order fruits and vegetables, then have it delivered to their
                        homes.

                            enables patients to hear the doctor's questions in their native African languages which allows them to respond appropriately. The application assists in preliminary communication between the doctor and the patient.

                        <p>To provide faster translation for the Hospital Translator Application, I explored using LSTM techniques to create a model that could automatically translate the ROS form from an one language to another. For my test case, I used
                            an algorithm to translate the ROS form from Swahili to English. So far, I have had some success with the results of translation. The algorithm will continue to be improved upon achieving better results.</p>

                        <p>I used Wandika, a platform where bloggers could share content and connect with other bloggers, as a web development project that I would use to learn and improve my front end and back end development skills. While I was developing
                            it, other students (masters and undergraduate) picked interest in working on the project with me. With the permission from the respective Professors, Wandika was then adopted as a project by which students who worked on it
                            and achieved significant success in the development of its various components, could use it as credit to fulfill some of their program requirements. For summer and Fall semester 2019, I was the team lead on the development
                            of Wandika. Myself and 2 other students (masters and undergraduate) built the different components of Wandika as an independent study course to fulfill MS Computer Sciences requirements and BS in Computer Sciences requirements
                            by the respective students. We all got an A in the course as assessed by the instructor based on our individual achievements in the development of the project.

            <h2>Past Work</h2>
            <p><strong>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING INTERN Jebbit Inc, Boston MA, June 2019 – Aug 2019 </strong> <br> Built a web application for the engineers to compare their code in production with the code in development. This helped them fix bugs and errors they might
                have missed during initial development and testing before deployment to production. Developed the application using Ember js framework and Ruby on Rails. Used Jira and Git version control system extensively during the project.

            </p>
            <p><strong> UNDERGRADUTE RESEARCH FELLOW, University at Buffalo, School of Engineering and Applied Science, Buffalo NY, Sept 2018 – Aug 2019 </strong> <br> Worked with Dr. Oliver Kennedy as a research assistant on his research project <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://odin.cse.buffalo.edu/research/mimir/">mimir</a> which is a data analysis tool. I built a tool called the <a href="https://github.com/kesamercy/DectectorForTypes">type-detector</a> in Java which is a part of the optimization
                implementation for mimir. It is one of the features that mimir uses to detect data types in columns of CSV files.

            <p>I'm a self starter. When I think of an idea, that I think is really cool, that I think could change lives, I don't wait for someone to make it happen. I do it. I build stuff I belive would have a positive impact on businnesses, people's lives
                or my resume :).</p>
            <p>I enjoy writing. I was the author of <a target="_blank" href="https://ubwp.buffalo.edu/csevoice/category/engineers-lounge/">Engineer's Lounge,</a> a blog where I shared beneficial resources on how to excel and succeeed as a Computer Science
                student in college.</p>

            <p>I do have a life that has nothing to do with code - or Computer Science for that matter. I enjoy swimming. Nothing close to professional, just enough to say I exceirse. I play piano. It helps when breaking away from the routine of writing
                code. I write poetry. Mostly inspired by life experiences. </p>
