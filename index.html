            <p>ENGINEERING INTERN Jebbit Inc, Boston MA, June 2019 – Aug 2019   Built a web application for the engineers to compare their code in production with the code in development. This tool improved their work efficiency by 50% as it was able to
                help them fix bugs or errors they might have missed during testing. Developed the application using Ember js framework and Ruby on Rails. Used Jira and Git version control system extensively during the project.

            <p>UNDERGRADUTE RESEARCH FELLOW University at Buffalo, School of Engineering and Applied Science, Buffalo NY, Sept 2018 – Aug 2019    Developed a command line tool in Java called a data type detector that determines dominant data types in
                each column of a CSV file. I used data structures and systems programming concepts like lists, array Lists, hash maps and threads to optimize efficiency and improve run time of the program especially when working with large data sets.
                Developed a web scrapper in Java to create a collection of regex to be used in the data type detector.
